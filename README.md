# bootstrap-responsive

This assignment was about creating an "About me" page using bootstrap and responsive design. I was able to create 3 html files (contact, index, portfolio) and one css for some styling. I used the css, Javascript and js query links from the web to link all the html's together and create the responsive design that allows me to have a drop down tab when the page is linked on a smaller screen or a smaller web browser.

I kept to a standard lay out for the nav bar and wnet with azure and light blue to make the site more appealing to the eyes. I also have the each html in a set of rows/colums to give it a more center view and make it easier to read.

I added a footer that is linked to to my LinkedIn account, as that might be beneficial (and I didn't want to type out an intro email).
