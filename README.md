# bootstrap-responsive

This assignment was about creating an "About me" page using bootstrap and responsive design. I was able to create 3 html files (contact, index, portfolio) and one css for some styling. I used the css, Javascript and js query links from the web to link all the html's together and create the responsive design that allows me to have a drop down tab when the page is linked on a smaller screen or a smaller web browser.

I kept to a standard lay out for the nav bar and went with azure and black to make the site more appealing to the eyes and to go along with my sky/space theme. I also have the each html in a set of rows/columns to give it a more center view and make it easier to read. The images are placed in a conatiner and are space related. The contact pge is also centered and functional.

I added a footer that is linked to to my LinkedIn account, as that might be beneficial and did some other minor touches on the bootstrap code to make the design easdier to read.
